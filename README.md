# A-new-compression-method-for-compressed-matching

This is the finale project for my studies cumputer science (B.Sc).
I worked with Omer Kissos.
We based on the article “A New Compression Method for Compressed Matching”.
The implementation is in C language.
We based our application on the LZSS implementation of Michael Dipperstein.

For more details look at the Book Project and the Article.
